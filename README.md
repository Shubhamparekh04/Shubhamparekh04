Hey there! Shubham here, your friendly neighborhood Web-head! 👋 I’m currently diving headfirst into the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and turning coffee into code ☕💻—because who needs sleep when you have caffeine and JavaScript, right?

I’m on a quest to build dynamic web applications that not only look great but also make users go, “Wow, how did they do that?” When I’m not knee-deep in code, you’ll find me exploring the latest tech trends, solving puzzles, or trying (and sometimes failing) to explain tech to my non-coding friends. 

Check out my creations below,(hosted on Netlify, because why not?):
